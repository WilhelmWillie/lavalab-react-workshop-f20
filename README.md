# LavaLab React Workshop Fall 2020

Hey there! This is a repo for a workshop ran by me for [USC LavaLab](https://usclavalab.org/)'s LavaLearn open curriculum initiative. This workshop is intended to teach the fundamentals of React, one of the most popular UI frameworks used for building web and mobile apps. While there are links and several details in this README, to capture the full value of this workshop, it's recommended you follow along my slides and video recording (~40 minutes). 

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wilhelm_willie) or via e-mail at wilhelmwillie@gmail.com

**Slides:** Link TBD

**Recording:** Link TBD

## Learning Outcomes

My goal is that after this workshop, you'll have a better understanding of:

- [ ] What React is and what it's capable of
- [ ] JSX and ES6 syntax
- [ ] React components, props and state, and the component lifecycle
- [ ] How to use hooks to manage data and breathe life into your React app

With limited time, it's okay if you don't fully understand everything presented in this workshop, but I hope at minimum this session is a net positive for you and your future development endeavors.

Note: This workshop is meant for beginners who are likely new to React and/or frontend development. If you already have React experience, this might not be as helpful to you. In the future, I might work on a follow-up workshop that dives into more complex topics.

## Pre-Requisites

This workshop is meant to be beginner friendly but some development experience is expected. You hopefully have some experience with HTML/CSS and/or beginner JavaScript. Also, it's very important to make sure you install Node.js and npm on your computer. Node.js' website can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en). MacOS installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos). Windows installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows).

**Again, make sure you have installed Node.js and npm.** To make sure it's been installed, run the following commands:

```
node --version
npm --version
```

Your Node version should be >= 8.10 and your npm verssion >= 5.6

Node is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside of the browser. npm is a package manager that lets you import third party dependencies into your projects. 

## How this workshop will work

My video recording that accompanies this workshop should cover everything in this README, the slides, and more. This README simply acts as supplementary material to help guide you if you get lost or need to refer to something. 

In the past, I've built projects from scratch during workshops. However, this time I'm switching it up by splitting this workshop into 3 sections:
* Introduction to React (10 mins) - Run through my slides and introduce some core concepts before we dive into code
* Live coding demo (10 mins) - I'll build a basic app that illustrates the core concepts of React and various implementation details
* Completed project walkthrough (10 mins) - Next, I'll walk through a slightly more complicated and polished app that showcases the concepts I just explained once again but in a slightly more complex way

Then to close out my workshop, I'll leave behind some challenges for you to complete after the workshop which build on top of the completed project. Hopefully after my workshop, you'll be able to expand on what I've built and put your newfound React knowledge to the test.

**Why this format?** Instead of walking you through how to build a project from scratch, line-by-line, I decided to maximize the time I have by explaining how things work with working examples instead of getting caught up in the granular line-by-line details. My hope is that learning from these examples will help reinforce the concepts better so you can extend/modify them to your needs
